1. Create gir repo and clone it in real
2. Create code.py and code to it.(it will save new file in a new file "data folder )
3. Do a git add commit push before intializing DVC
4. Pip install DVC 
5. how we do dvc init (creates,.dvcignore,.dvc)
6. How to make dirs s3 (creates new s3 directory)
7. how to "DVC REMOTE ADD -d myremote s3"
8. next"DVC add data/"
 Now it will ask to do:(git rm -r --cached 'data' and git commit -m""Storptracking data)
 Because initally we were tracking data/folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
9. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
10. now "dvc commit"and the "dvc push"
11. now need to git add commit push to mark this satge as first version of data
12. now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data check chnages via "dv status"
13. again -- dvc commit and then dvc push
14. Then git add commit push (we're saving v2 of our data at this point)
15. check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
16. Now repeat step 12-14 for v3 of data
